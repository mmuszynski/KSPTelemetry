     When the connection begins, it tells the server how long it plans to listen. The server will
     respect this and will only send packets until the time at which the server asked to stop listening.
     
     When the server receives a new connection, it will attempt to send a unix time to represent
     the time at which it will stop serving packets to this client. There is unlikely to be a
     disconnect message created by the server (instead, relying on timeout if this method fails).
